Sir
This vercel app doesn't work due to failed connection from mysql server, (could not come across free mysql server hosting platform).
If the database schema provided in "Schema-design" is copied in the localhost and .env file is adjusted according to it then it works well.
Although the git repo contains a vercel link to show the basic api interface.
